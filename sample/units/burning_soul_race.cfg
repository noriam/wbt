    description= _ "Burning Souls are the tormented spirits of people who were slain by demons or otherwise dragged into Inferno. Their free will was suppressed by insanity eons ago, and the only thing that exists for them is pain and sorrow. Uria's demons are torturing them all the time by making their entire bodies including their insides burn, and regenerate all the time to survive it forever. They also control their limbs, either to make them torture themselves even more if it is even possible or to fight against Uria's foes.

The ultimate thing the Burning Souls seek is their own death, because only death can free them from their torment, although it is speculated that enough accumulated sanity and mental strength with some external help might be able to free them from their torment as well."
