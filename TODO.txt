TODO LIST :

1. Display on screen a window for our program.
The window is split in two parts :
    - The Unit on the LEFT side
    - The Unit on the RIGHT side
Over those two parts, there are two menus :
    - Select a Unit from the game
    - Select your home-made Unit
The program compare the two Units when both are selected,
or only print the power score of it if there is only one.
At the bottom of the window, there must be the synthesis of the comparison.
