    description= _ "Black Souls are a kind of spirits that is not just summoned and commanded by a necromancer. They are spirits that have refused the natural order and decided to return into the world of the living somehow, and spread their evil over there. If they are locked in the world of the dead, they pose a little thread to the living, but if they find a way to break in, the consequences might be terrible.

Incredibly strong and persistant, not hesitating to unite with demons or other monstrosities, they are terrible opponents under any circumstances."
